====---- Wasteland Generators ----====
Adds two new world generators, A desert based one and a snow based one. Made for my own modpacks it generates a single biome world either
Sand/desert like or snow

It attempts to remove all vegetation and animals so you will need as a modpack dev to re-add them as required
